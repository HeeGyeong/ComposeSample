# ComposeSample App Module

## Overview
This document describes the App module of ComposeSample. This module includes examples of building UI using Jetpack Compose and implementing various features. It is designed according to Clean Architecture principles.

## Project Structure
```
ComposeSample
└── app
    ├── Application # Application class for Koin initialization
    ├── db # Local database
    ├── di # Module for dependency injection
    ├── presentation # UI layer (Activity, Compose UI)
    ├── util # Utility classes
    └── UI # Theme files generated by default when creating a Compose Project
```

## Key Components
- **MainActivity**: Main screen that provides navigation to example code and legacy code
- **BlogExampleActivity**: Various feature implementation examples created for practical use

## Key Features

### 1. API
- **Description**: Includes ViewModel and related components responsible for communication with the API. Provides functionality to detect network status and fetch data through API calls.

### 2. BottomSheet
- **Description**: A component that implements BottomSheet UI, displaying various content for user interaction. Includes Modal BottomSheet and Collapsed BottomSheet.

### 3. Navigation
- **Description**: A component that manages navigation between screens within the app. Includes Bottom Navigation and Custom Navigation to help users easily switch screens.

### 4. Swipe
- **Description**: Provides a UI that allows users to swipe items to delete them. Items can be easily removed through swipe gestures.

### 5. Pager
- **Description**: Provides a UI for navigating through multiple pages by swiping. Each page can have independent content.

### 6. LazyColumn
- **Description**: A component that implements a scrollable list, efficiently displaying large amounts of data. LazyColumn loads items only when needed.

### 7. Shimmer
- **Description**: Provides a Shimmer effect to visually represent loading states. It gives feedback to users while data is being loaded.

### 8. Effect
- **Description**: Provides a UI that handles side effects based on state changes using Compose's SideEffect. Specific actions can be performed when data changes.

### 9. FlexBox
- **Description**: Provides a FlexBox UI for implementing fluid layouts. It automatically adjusts based on the size and number of items.

### 10. Drawer
- **Description**: Provides a Drawer UI for implementing a side menu. Includes functionality for users to open and close the menu.

### 11. Animation
- **Description**: Includes examples of implementing various animation effects.

### 12. Coroutine
- **Description**: Includes examples of asynchronous processing using Coroutines.

### 13. Test
- **Description**: Includes examples of implementing UI tests.

### 14. MVI
- **Description**: Includes examples of implementing the MVI architecture pattern.

### 15. Coordinator
- **Description**: Includes examples of screen transitions using the Coordinator pattern.

### Others
- For many folders not mentioned above, you can intuitively distinguish them by their folder names, so please check them if necessary.

## Dependency Injection
The App module manages dependency injection using Koin. Define the necessary modules in the `di` package and register all modules in the `InjectModules.kt` file.

## Usage
1. Build the project.
2. Run MainActivity to navigate to either example code or legacy code.
3. Check various features in BlogExampleActivity.

## Caution
- Ensure that the Compose version and Kotlin version are compatible.
- Necessary permissions must be set in the AndroidManifest.xml file.
- Team approval is required for adding new libraries.
- Version modifications are prohibited.
- Domain layer must be pure Kotlin.
- Presentation layer must use Compose.
- Clear separation between layers is required.
