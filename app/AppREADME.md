## Overview
This document describes the App module of ComposeSample. This module includes examples of building UI using Jetpack Compose and implementing various features. It is designed according to Clean Architecture principles.

## Project Structure
```
ComposeSample
└── app
    ├── Application # Application class for Koin initialization
    ├── db # Local database
    ├── di # Module for dependency injection
    ├── presentation # UI layer (Activity, Compose UI)
    ├── util # Utility classes
    └── UI # Theme files generated by default when creating a Compose Project
```

## Key Components
- **MainActivity**: Example using Legacy Compose written in the past.
- **BlogExampleActivity**: Various feature implementation examples created for practical use.

### Others
- For many folders not mentioned above, you can intuitively distinguish them by their folder names, so please check them if necessary.

## Dependency Injection
The App module manages dependency injection using Koin. Define the necessary modules in the `di` package and register all modules in the `InjectModules.kt` file.

## Usage
1. Build the project.
2. Run BlogExampleActivity to check various features.
3. If you need additional features, please let us know through the blog, and we will create additional examples.

## Caution
- Ensure that the Compose version and Kotlin version are compatible.
- Necessary permissions must be set in the AndroidManifest.xml file.

## Conclusion
This README.md document provides basic information about the App module of ComposeSample. It aims to help you understand and utilize each component and feature.
